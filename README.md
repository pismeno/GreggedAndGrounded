# GreggedAndGrounded
Gregged &amp; Grounded is a long progression based modpack! Main mods are Gregtech, Galacticraft, Actually Additions, Forestry, BWM and Tinkers Construct. \ 
 \ 
You start as a caveman, using basic tools, obtaining basic resources and processing basic things like leather, then you move to next age: Mechanical age. Now your main goal is to get to the Bronze Age and make steam machines, after that you progress and use Electricity! You will fly to the Moon, Mars, Venus, Mercury and other planets! \ 
 \ 
The modpack focuses on deep integration between the mod that should feel very refined! From being able to use every Gregtech material, to using Game Stages  and locking different aspects of the game to different ages! I have tweaked almost every aspect of the game: from looting, recipes (thousands of them), food, tools to world gen and even sound effects! \ 
 \ 
It includes custom machines. multiblocks, Tinkers Construct materials and items! \
